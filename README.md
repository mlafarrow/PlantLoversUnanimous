## Project 1: Plant Lovers Unanimous
#### by Emily Farrow



### Overview
This is a website geared towards younger generations like Gen Z and young Millenials who love plants but are at all different levels of plant care. This goes through different plants they can get based on their level of expertise and experience while also giving recommendations on things to buy as well. 


### Technical Details

I used variables and arrays to store all of the .png files I used for this project. There is separate functions for the different states in the website that link to the different arrays. There is a navKey array and if else statements used to navigate through the states.
